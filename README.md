# Web4Developers

A project carried out by me in the context of the FullStack Web Developer course at Flag.
This consists of website related to my study group, myself and three other colleagues, whom we named
Web4Developers. <br>
We will show all the projects already developed by us, until the
date and a little bit of our journey, with which each one identifies professionally. <br>
I developed this project with the languages, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Mysql, SQL and PHP.
